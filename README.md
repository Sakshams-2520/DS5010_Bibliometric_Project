# DS5010_Bibliometric_Project
Quantitative evaluation of content is a fundamental part of publishing in scientific fields to evaluate validity, growth, maturity, leading authors, conceptual and intellectual maps, trends of a scientific community. This package provides tools for bibliometrics and citation analysis by enabling users to evaluate the impact of any research quantitatively. The model enables comparison between different research domains or researchers and evaluates their existing impact. For the scope of this project, impact of papers is determined on the basis of “author” and “journal” parameters.
